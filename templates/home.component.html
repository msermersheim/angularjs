  <h5>Why do your customers need power protection?</h5>
  <p>
    A high-quality power protection solution is among the most cost-effective measures to prevent downtime. With the ability to cause irreparable damage and irretrievable loss of revenue, an unexpected loss of power can be crippling to an organization. Power outages, surges and spikes are estimated to ring up more than $150 billion in annual damages to the U.S. economy. And according to Dunn & Bradstreet, 59 percent of Fortune 500 companies experience at least 1.6 hours of downtime per week.

  <p>
    While downtime costs vary by industry and by the scale of business operations, some of the negative consequences include lost transaction revenue, wages and inventory; remedial labor costs; marketing costs; bank fees; and legal penalties from not delivering on service level agreements. And donâ€™t forget the damages resulting from missed business opportunities; decreases in stock value; loss of customer/partner goodwill; brand damage; driving business to competitors; and bad publicity/press.
